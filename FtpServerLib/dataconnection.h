// This class encapsulates the logic of the creation of both passive and active
// data connections. In short - there can be only one data connection per
// control connection. If a new one is requested while there is one being used
// currently, the operation using it is aborted. A new data connection starts
// when a PASV or PORT command is issued. Then the user must specify a command
// that uses the data connection, such as LIST or RETR/STOR. If we have
// encryption enabled, the data connection is also first encrypted. Once we
// have the command, and are connected to the client, and the connection has
// been encrypted, we run the command.
